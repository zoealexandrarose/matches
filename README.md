Hi all,

I know it was said to limit the use of libraries, so I’ve only used Bootstrap for my CSS - I thought it would be too time consuming otherwise. For that, I’ve chosen not to implement a CDN just in case something goes wrong/it fails and causes the CSS (mainly the columns) to break.
I’m struggling with the responsive side of things but otherwise all seemed okay.

Thanks!
